## Instructions: How to Run?

- [laragon](https://laragon.org/docs/install.html) was use to run this project.

- After you finish downloading the project, unzip the project file and head over to your Laragon directory. There you’ll find a folder naming “www”.

- Inside the “www” folder, paste the project folder (not the .zip one, but the extracted one).

- Open your favorite browser; I recommend using Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox.

- Then, go to URL “http://localhost/phpmyadmin“.

- Create a Database with the name “img_tbl”.

- Click on the “Import” tab and choose the database file (.sql) which is provided under the folder naming “database”.

- After setting up all these, go to URL “http://localhost/[ ENTER_PROJECT_FOLDER_NAME_HERE ]“

- That's it.
